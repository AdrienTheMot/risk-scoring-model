# Risk Scoring Model (Demo)

A minimal **credit risk scoring** pipeline in Python using scikit-learn.
Watered down version of what I made for ClarityPay.

## Contents
- `risk_pipeline.py` – reusable pipeline (fit, save, load, predict_proba)
- `example_data.csv` – synthetic demo dataset
- `demo.ipynb` – notebook walkthrough
- `requirements.txt` – dependencies

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open `demo.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter to see training and scoring in action.
